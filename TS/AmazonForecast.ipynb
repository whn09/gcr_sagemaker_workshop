    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will try to use [Amaozn Forecast](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/what-is-forecast.html), a fully managed service that uses machine learning to deliver highly accurate forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amzon Forecast offer 5 algorithm now, they are ARIMA, DeepAR+, ETS, NPTS and Prophet, you can use one of them or enable **Auto ML** option to let Amzon Forecast choose algorithm for you. In this lab, we will use Prophet for example, you can use other algorithm as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequest\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have a proper permission to use Amazon Forecast, can create IAM role for Amzon Forecast. You can follow follow link to find out how to create IAM role.\n",
