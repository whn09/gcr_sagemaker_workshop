# Recommendation-System-based-on-TensorFlow
I have updated all files in my project and provided data used in this system, and this project is still in optimization period because of some good ideas appearing from CSDN.
This system is mainly based on generation networks in YouTube's recommender system, which is modified according to the features of available data.
This is my first project that I think proper to beposted on Github, welcome to any suggestions and criticisms!
