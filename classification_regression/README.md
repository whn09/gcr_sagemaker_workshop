# Task1 - Predicting FIFA players' 'OVERALL'

In this lab, you are provided with a dataset (FIFA 19 players) contains over 12,000+ rows with 89 columns.

The dataset includes lastest edition FIFA 2019 players attributes like Age, Nationality, Overall, Potential, Club, Value, Wage, Preferred Foot, International Reputation, Weak Foot, Skill Moves, Work Rate, Position, Jersey Number, Joined, Loaned From, Contract Valid Until, Height, Weight, LS, ST, RS, LW, LF, CF, RF, RW, LAM, CAM, RAM, LM, LCM, CM, RCM, RM, LWB, LDM, CDM, RDM, RWB, LB, LCB, CB, RCB, RB, Crossing, Finishing, Heading, Accuracy, ShortPassing, Volleys, Dribbling, Curve, FKAccuracy, LongPassing, BallControl, Acceleration, SprintSpeed, Agility, Reactions, Balance, ShotPower, Jumping, Stamina, Strength, LongShots, Aggression, Interceptions, Positioning, Vision, Penalties, Composure, Marking, StandingTackle, SlidingTackle, GKDiving, GKHandling, GKKicking, GKPositioning, GKReflexes, and Release Clause.

In this dataset, label column is ‘Overall’. You’re required to predict the overall number of players based on other attributes.

Demo data insights and model training (introduced in today’s session) are provided.

You are encouraged to extract features, find more potential evidences, or even use tricky operations to reach the best accuracy score.

After 1 hour’s experiment, we will provide another new dataset to test your model. So please try to do your best!
