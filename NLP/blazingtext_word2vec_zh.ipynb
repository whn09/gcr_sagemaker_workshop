The GPU implementation uses highly optimized CUDA kernels. To learn more, please refer to [*BlazingText: Scaling and Accelerating Word2Vec using Multiple GPUs*](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3146347.3146354). BlazingText also supports learning of subword embeddings with CBOW and skip-gram modes. This enables BlazingText to generate vectors for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, as demonstrated in this [notebook](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8.ipynb).\n",

This mode enables distributed word2vec training across multiple CPU nodes, allowing almost linear scale up of word2vec computation to process hundreds of millions of words per second.
